Experimentation Strategy
1. Objective

To validate whether AI-assisted article drafting improves author efficiency while maintaining editorial quality.

Because this is a prototype, experimentation is defined conceptually and can be implemented in future production environments.

2. Experiment Hypothesis

If authors use AI-assisted drafting tools, then:

Time-to-draft will decrease.

SEO completeness will improve.

Tag consistency will improve.

Editorial revision effort will not increase significantly.

3. Experiment Design (Future Deployment Scenario)
3.1 Controlled Rollout

Two groups:

Group A — Manual Workflow
Group B — AI-Assisted Workflow

Both groups operate under identical publishing conditions.

3.2 Measurement Metrics
Metric	Definition
Time to draft	Minutes from start to draft submission
Revision count	Number of edits before approval
SEO completeness score	Structured SEO validation score
Tag duplication rate	Duplicate tag occurrence
Editor override rate	% of AI output heavily modified
4. Success Criteria

≥ 20% reduction in time-to-draft.

Tag duplication rate = 0%.

No increase in revision count.

Editor satisfaction score ≥ baseline.

5. Statistical Considerations

Minimum 30 articles per group.

2-week test period.

Compare means across metrics.

Manual qualitative review included.

6. Qualitative Feedback Collection

Editors asked:

Did AI reduce drafting time?

Was output trustworthy?

Which section required most editing?

Would you use this regularly?

7. Failure Threshold

Rollback AI-assisted workflow if:

Revision count increases > 30%.

Hallucination rate > 5%.

Editor dissatisfaction increases significantly.

8. Prototype-Level Testing

For current prototype:

Generate 20 test articles.

Score using evaluation rubric.

Document findings.

Iterate prompt design.
